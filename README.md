# SLICER
Fruit Ninja influenced game! I chose to make this game because fruit ninja is one of my mosy favorite mobile games. I also had strong belief that making this myself would be extremely doable. The game isnt too intricate, and should be fairly easy to make.


## Rules :
* Slice the objects as they appear on the screen
* Miss three objects and you lose the game
* Use your mouse cursor to slice through the objects
* There will be a total of 5 - 10 objects on the screen, GOOD LUCK!
